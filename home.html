        <li>
            Starting with the gold plan, you can use nameserver branding. Brandable nameservers allow a webmaster to use their own domain in their delegations.
            
            For example, Instead of :
            NS1.AFRAID.ORG
            NS2.AFRAID.ORG
            NS3.AFRAID.ORG
            NS4.AFRAID.ORG
            
            You could use:
            NS1.YOURBUSINESS.COM
            NS2.YOURBUSINESS.COM
            NS3.YOURBUSINESS.COM
            NS4.YOURBUSINESS.COM
            
            This allows you to further impress your clients by appearing to operate your own nameservers with your company name in distributed locations!
            
            This also means you're not sharing any naming resources with the free users, providing you the highest level of reliable service.</li>
